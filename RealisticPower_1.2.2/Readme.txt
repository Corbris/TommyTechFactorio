Intended to be used with Clockwork for 24h days (ingame mod setting for day lengths, default 24h).
Don't forget to set the Capacity Multiplier (startup settings) and the Clockwork Daylength Multiplier (map settings) to 205 for 24h days! (34 for 4h days)

Do you like solar panels, a lot? Is your inner physicist crying whenever you think about how ridiculously powerful vanilla solar panels are? Do you think power is too easy to get? This mod is for you!

This mod makes power harder to get. Solar panels produce a lower and more realistic amount of power, fuel values are nerfed as well. Accumulators buffed for more realistic values and allow 24h days, plus there is a new type of accumulator with very high power but low capacity. Nuclear power uses more fuel.
Accumulator / panels ratios are quite different and depend on the day cycle length (New ratios: http://i.imgur.com/boWZaKa.jpg).

Nuclear reactors are harder to get and consume more fuel than normal, forcing you to rely on other power sources for longer.


Supports:
- Bob's mods (toggle in config.lua for all solar panels requiring wafers)
- Angel's mods
- Yuoki's mods
- Wind Turbine, Wind Turbines
- Pyanodons Coal Processing / Fusion
- ...


Known Issues:
- High power accumulators can't have even lower priority than regular accumulators so you have to make a separate electric network for them (like for lasers) to be meaningful if your main power source is solar.
